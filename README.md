# TDD Kata

## TODOS
Please make sure to setup your IDE beforehand as described below.

If you need help, please reach out :)

* [ ] Check out the repository and open it with IntelliJ Idea CE
* [ ] Install the 'Kotest' plugin in the IntelliJ preferences
* [ ] Open `Example.kt` and `ExampleTest.kt` side by side
* [ ] Run the tests by clicking the play icon next to `class MainTest`
  * -> one should be green, one should be red
* [ ] There is an error in the implementation, fix it and run the tests again
  * -> both tests are green? you are good to go!
